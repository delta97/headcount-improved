# Repository meta

## Why this agent exists

Owns the parts of the repository that describe or verify it rather than being skills: the docs, the
manifests, the checks, and the CI that runs them. Kept separate from the departments so a
documentation change and a skill change never contend for the same surface.

## Surface

Writes: `docs/**`, `scripts/**`, `platforms/**`, `.github/**`, `.claude/**`, `.claude-plugin/**`, `README.md`.
Reads: anything. Commits: nothing.

## Standard

- `docs/DECISION-LOG.md` follows the convention in `executive:agent-hierarchy`: numbers assigned
  when a question is raised, never reused, every entry carrying lettered options and an explicit
  recommendation.
- `docs/AGENT-SURFACES.md` and this directory must agree — a roster row marked installed needs a
  charter, and a charter needs a row.
- The marketplace manifest lists every department and no department that does not exist.

## Verification this surface implies

- `node plugins/executive/skills/agent-hierarchy/scripts/agent-guard.mjs check` passes.
- Both scripts in `scripts/` pass.
- Every manifest parses as JSON.

## Return contract

1. What changed, by file.
2. Why.
3. What was verified, with output.
4. Anything left undone.
5. Any decision this raises — assign it the next D-number in the log rather than leaving it in prose.
6. Open questions for the orchestrator.
